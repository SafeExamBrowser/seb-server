SEB Server Ans Delft Integration
===============================

The `Ans Delft <https://ans.app>`_ Assessment Tool can be integrated with SEB Server for the most common features like

- Course Access
- SEB Course Restriction
- Login Name Resolving

SEB Server uses the existing `Ans Delft API <https://ans.app/api/docs/index.html>`_ to apply the integration. 
As usual you need a valid Ans client API account from Ans Delft to be able to connect SEB Server with your 
Ans server. Please create or request such an account from the Ans team, and use either the given credentials or
a given access-token to connect SEB Server to the Ans API.

All the above listed Assessment Tool integration features should then work as described within SEB Server.
