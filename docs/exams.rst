Within an exam in SEB server all threads come together to set up a e-assessment with Safe Exam Browser and SEB Server. An exam can be imported
from a course that exists on an LMS that was binded with a LMS Setup. An exam configuration that was formerly created can be attached to the exam by 
choosing one from the library. Indicators can be defined that are shown in the monitoring section while monitoring a running exam. And if
the API of the specified LMS integration supports individual SEB restriction attributes for a e-assessment, this can also be defined and managed
on the exam management of SEB Server.

We will go through all the steps to setting up an exam for Safe Exam Browser with SEB Server one by one.
