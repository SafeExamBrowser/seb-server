Exam Template
==================

Overview
--------

Exam templates are a new, useful feature available since SEB Server version 1.3. Within exam templates it is possible to create specific named templates that can be 
used by an exam import from LMS/Assessment Tool course/quiz and define default settings and indicators that are automatically be applied on the exam import.
Furthermore, exam templates gives you the possibility to map exam configuration template to automatically create and map an exam configuration for an exam on import.
This is very convenient if you have a lot of exams to set up that all have the same or similar settings. In such a case you can create an exam template 
with all the common settings for that exams and use it on exam import.

Exam templates can be created and managed just like other SEB Server documents within its list/library. The list can be filtered by name and type of the exam template
and also shows which one is the default for the institution.

.. note:: 
    The "Default Template" flag indicates the one exam template that is the default template for an institution. This just means that this template
    is preselected on the exam import if it exists.


Create new Exam Template
------------------------

To create a new exam template please use the "Add Exam Template" action on the right action pane in the "Exam Template" list view.
SEB Server will then present you the exam template creation view on that some initial settings can be made.

    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-server/master/docs/images/exam_template/new.png

- **Name** The name of the exam template to identify it in the list/library
- **Description** A short description ideally describing the purpose of the exam template
- **Institutional Default** This flag indicated if the exam template shall become the default exam template for the institution.
- **Exam Type** Here you can set the exam type that shall be used when an exam is imported within this template
- **Configuration Template** Select an existing exam configuration template. This template will be used to automatically create and map an exam configuration for an exam that is imported with this template
- **Exam Supporter** Add a list of available exam supporter to the template. These exam supporter will then be assigned to an exam that is imported with this template

After having done all the initial settings, the exam template can be created by saving the settings. SEB Server will then present you the exam template administration
view that looks similar to the exam administration view.

    :align: center
    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-server/master/docs/images/exam_template/view.png

Here you can edit the settings done before by using the "Edit Exam Template" action form the right action pane.
You can also delete an exam template entirely by using the "Delete Exam Template" action from the right action pane.
And you are able to add/edit/remove monitoring indicators for the exam template just like you would do for exams in the exam administration view.

There are also proctoring settings available since SEB Server version 1.4 for the exam template. They just have the same settings and
look like the ones on the Exam and will get copied for an exam imported with the respective template that defines the proctoring settings.

Import Exam with Template
-------------------------

Once one or more exam template exists, you are able to select one while importing an exam from the LMS/Assessment Tool in the "LMS/Assessment Tool Exam Lookup" section. Just as usual
use the "Import as Exam" action for a LMS/Assessment Tool exam that you want to import.

    :align: center
    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-server/master/docs/images/exam_template/select1.png
    
Now there is a new selector field named "Exam Template" where you can choose the exam template to use on import. When you select one the template attributes
like "Exam Type" or "Exam Supporter" are automatically applied from the template settings. You are still able to edit the settings e.g. add more or remove supporter.

If all settings are correct, use the "Save Exam" action from the right action pane to finish up the import. On this step, if the template defines some indicators,
this indicators are automatically be created and applied for the exam. The same applies to an exam configuration template that is defined by the exam template, a
new Exam Configuration is automatically created by the system from that configuration template and the new exam configuration is applied to the exam.

.. note:: 
    When an Exam Configuration is automatically be created during an exam import with template, the name for that new Exam Configuration is dynamically 
    generated with the current date and the name of the exam. Also an appropriate description for the Exam Configuration is generated. 
    It is surely possible to just change the name or description of the generated Exam Configuration afterwards.
    
After successful exam import you see the exam administration view just as usual but with auto generated configuration and indicators from the template.
After import you can modify the exam setup as usual by changing, removing or adding settings or indicators to the exam. This will not have any effect to the selected exam template
that is only used and applied within the import process at the moment. But the exam template that has been used on import is always been shown on the exam 
overview as a reference.

.. note:: 
    A Change in a template is not reflected within already existing exams that used that template on import.
    But it will affect all future exams that use this template on import.
