   * - Term
     - What it is
     - If set up
     - If not set up
   * - Config Key (CK)
     - | A cryptographic key used to authenticate the Safe Exam Browser configuration used for an exam to ensure that 
       | only authorized users can change the configuration. There is a unique key for each configuration. Any change 
       | to the configuration file content (e.g. modifying settings) will alter the signature, making unauthorized 
       | changes detectable.
     - Only clients with the correct config file can access the exam with SEB.
     - Any SEB config can be used for the exam.
   * - SEB Server Exam Key
     - | A cryptographic key generated by the Safe Exam Browser Server to identify the exam and ensure that only 
       | authorized devices can access the exam. It ties SEB clients to a specific exam setup. Changing the exam 
       | settings or creating a new exam generates a new key. This ensures only clients launched for that 
       | specific exam can connect.
     - Only SEB clients with a matching exam key can access the exam.
     - Any SEB client can access the exam.
   * - Browser Exam Key (BEK)
     - | A cryptographic key used for enhanced verification. It is tied to Safe Exam Browser versions/builds and the 
       | used SEB exam settings/configuration. The BEK has to be manually copy-pasted from the configuration/settings 
       | user interface of each SEB version used (SEB Windows Configuration Tool or SEB in-app Settings menus on 
       | macOS/iOS). Note that you first have to finalize and save the configuration file and then copy-paste the 
       | BEKs from each SEB version without re-saving the config file (as this always changes the BEK). Modifying 
       | browser-related exam settings (e.g. permitted resources or behaviour) will generate a new BEK.
     - Only SEB clients with correct config file/SEB build (matching BEK) can connect.
     - Only the Config Key is verified.
   * - Additional Browser Exam Key (BEK)
     - | An additional cryptographic key, currently used for consecutive exams. Copy the SEB Server Exam Key of the 
       | first exam into the field for additional browser exam keys of the second exam.
     - | Only SEB clients sending either a correct SEB Server Exam Key or a matching Additional Browser Exam Key can 
       | access the exam.
     - Only the Exam key is verified, additional BEK checks are skipped.
   * - App-Signature Key (ASK)
     - | A cryptographic key used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the Safe Exam Browser application to 
       | ensure that the application has not been tampered with. The ASK is created at runtime. There is a unique ASK 
       | for every official SEB release and build. Each manipulation of the SEB application in any way will change the 
       | ASK of that SEB.
     - Only clients providing an accepted ASK are granted.
     - Any client providing any ASK or none is granted.
