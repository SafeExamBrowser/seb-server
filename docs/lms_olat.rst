SEB Server OLAT Integration
===============================

The `OLAT <https://www.olat.org/>`_ Assessment Tool can be integrated with SEB Server for the most common features:

- Course Access
- SEB Course Restriction
- Login Name Resolving

SEB Server integration with OLAT was built with close coworking with the OLAT development team and uses the
existing OLAT API to apply the integration. As usual you need a valid client API account from you OLAT server instance 
to be able to connect SEB Server. Please create or request such an account from the OLAT team, and use either the 
given credentials or a given access-token to connect SEB Server to the Ans API.
